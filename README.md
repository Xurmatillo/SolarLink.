This code sets up the ESP8266 in station mode to connect to your existing WiFi network. Once it connects to your network, it then disconnects from it and sets up an access point with the SSID "ESP8266 Repeater" and password "password". Finally, it reconnects to your existing network in station mode to start repeating the signal.

Note that this is a basic code and you may need to modify it depending on your specific needs and requirements.

I hope this helps you get started with your project. Let me know if you have any further questions!
